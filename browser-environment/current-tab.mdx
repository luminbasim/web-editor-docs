title: "Current Tab"
---

The **current tab** is the default tab the workflow engine will target when executing a node that either interacts with the DOM or affects browser navigation.

When a workflow is initiated, its current tab is the same as the initial tab. Whenever a new tab (or window) is created, the current tab will be set to the newly created tab (or the tab of the newly created window).
