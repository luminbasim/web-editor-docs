title: "Loop Data by Code"
---

The data for a **Loop Data Block** node can be specified using a storage code expression. This storage code expression should return an array. When the **Loop Data Block** node is executed, the storage code expression will be run and the loop will iterate through each element of the array.

To create a **Loop Data Block** by code loop:

1. Create a **Loop Data Block**.

2. Edit the newly created node by setting the `Loop through` field to `code`.

   <img
     style={{ maxHeight: "400px", margin: "auto" }}
     src="/images/img72.png"
   />

3. Click the `Open Editor` button of the `Code` field.

4. Edit the storage code expression in the code editor. This function should return an array.

5. Click the `Save` button of the code editor.

6. Click the `Submit` button of the node configuration form.
