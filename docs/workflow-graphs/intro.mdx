Steps in a workflow are represented as nodes in a graph. Nodes are executed in order starting from the initial `trigger` node, and ending when the last executed node does not have an edge to another node.

Every node has a `node type`, which corresponds to the task it will perform when executed. For example, a node with node type `Show Info Modal` will display a message in a modal.

In this section we will go more in depth on how to create and configure a node, and how to connect nodes in our graph.
