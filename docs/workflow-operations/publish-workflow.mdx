title: Publishing a Workflow
---

Changes to a workflow must be published in order to be visible to the end-user.
To publish a workflow, click the `Upload` icon on the top left corner of the editor:

<img style={{ maxHeight: "400px", margin: "auto" }} src="/images/img26.png" />

> **Note:** Any build errors will prevent you from publishing your workflow.
