We can view the contents of workflow storage at any node by the following process:

1. Click on the node to open its node configuration form.

2. Click on the `View Storage` button.

<img style={{ maxHeight: "400px", margin: "auto" }} src="/images/img38.png" />

This will open a modal that shows the contents of storage and their corresponding types.
