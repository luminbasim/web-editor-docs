## Step 1: Creating the Workflow

To create your workflow:

1. Navigate to https://web-editor.onrender.com/home in Chrome.
2. Log in to your Luminai account.
3. Click the <strong>Create Workflow</strong> button.
4. Fill in the form as follows (see image below):

   - <strong>Company:</strong> Select `company/luminai`
   - <strong>Team:</strong> Enter your Luminai user name (Ex: If your Luminai email
     is karl@luminai.com, then your team will be `karl`)
   - <strong>ID:</strong> Enter `01-hello-world`
   - <strong>Display Name:</strong> Enter `01) Hello World`
   - <strong>Description:</strong> Enter `A simple “Hello World” workflow`

<img style={{ maxHeight: "400px", margin: "auto" }} src="/images/img1.png" />

5. Click the Create button.

When complete, you should be redirected to the editor of your newly created workflow.

## Step 2: Adding a Node to the Workflow

Steps in a workflow are represented as nodes in a graph. Nodes are executed in order starting from the initial `trigger` node. In this section, we will add `Show Info Modal` node that will display the message `“Hello World”` in a modal.

1.  Click the `Search` box on the left side of the editor and type `show info`.

          <img style={{"maxHeight": "400px", "margin": "auto"}} src="/images/img2.png" />

2.  Drag and drop the `Show Info Modal` box to the graph (see image below):

    <img
      style={{ maxHeight: "400px", margin: "auto" }}
      src="/images/img3.png"
    />
    At this stage, a new node with the name `show_message_modal` will be added to
    the graph. Note that node names in a workflow are unique.

3.  Create an edge from the `trigger` node to the `show_message_modal` node by dragging the output handle of `trigger` to the input handle of `show_message_modal` (see image below).
    <img
      style={{ maxHeight: "400px", margin: "auto" }}
      src="/images/img4.png"
    />
4.  Click the `show_message_modal` node. The node’s configuration form will popup on the right side of the editor. Fill in the form as shown below:
    <img
      style={{ maxHeight: "400px", margin: "auto" }}
      src="/images/img5.png"
    />
5.  Click the `Submit` button.

## Step 3: Saving and Testing the Workflow

1. To save the workflow, click the `save icon` in the top left corner of the editor (as shown below).
   <img style={{ maxHeight: "400px", margin: "auto" }} src="/images/img6.png" />
2. To test the workflow, click the `play icon` in the top left corner of the editor (as shown below).

   <img style={{ maxHeight: "400px", margin: "auto" }} src="/images/img7.png" />

   The workflow should run and you should now see a modal displaying the message
   `“Hello world”`.

   <img style={{ maxHeight: "400px", margin: "auto" }} src="/images/img8.png" />
