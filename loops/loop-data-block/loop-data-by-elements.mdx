title: "Loop Data by Elements"

The **Loop Data Block** node can also be used (in a sense) to iterate through an array of DOM elements.

To do this:

1. Create a **Loop Data Block**.

2. Edit the newly created node by setting the `Loop through` field to selector.

   <img
     style={{ maxHeight: "400px", margin: "auto" }}
     src="/images/img73.png"
   />

3. Specify the selector for the elements you want to iterate through (this can be specified via a storage code expression).

4. Click the `Submit` button of the node configuration form.

When executed, the **Loop Data Block** will use the provided selector, and add a unique attribute to each element satisfying the selector. An array of selectors targeting these attributes will be created; each selector will be iterated through in the loop.

For example, for the HTML document below,

<img style={{ maxHeight: "400px", margin: "auto" }} src="/images/img74.png" />

if we loop through the p tag elements using the Loop Data Block shown below:

<img style={{ maxHeight: "400px", margin: "auto" }} src="/images/img75.png" />

Then when the Loop Data Block is executed, the workflow engine will add a luminai-rpa-loop attribute to every element satisfying the selector (in this case, every element with the p tag). For each element satisfying the selector, the attribute’s value will be set to “{YOUR_LOOP_ID}--{INDEX_OF_ELEMENT}”. So, assuming our loopId is sample, our HTML document will become:

<img style={{ maxHeight: "400px", margin: "auto" }} src="/images/img76.png" />

The loop will then iterate through an array containing selectors that target each element in order:

<img style={{ maxHeight: "400px", margin: "auto" }} src="/images/img77.png" />
