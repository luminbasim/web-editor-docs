title: Creating a Node of Type

To create a new node whose node type is `{NODE_TYPE}`:

1. Click the `Search` box on the left side of the editor and type start typing in the `{NODE_TYPE}`. In the image below, we are creating a node whose `NODE_TYPE` is `Show Info Modal`.

   <img style={{ maxHeight: "400px", margin: "auto" }} src="/images/img9.png" />

2. Once you see a box with your corresponding `{NODE_TYPE}`, drag and drop the box onto the graph. In the image below, we are dragging and dropping a `Show Info Modal` type node onto the graph.
   <img
     style={{ maxHeight: "400px", margin: "auto" }}
     src="/images/img10.png"
   />
