title: Configuring a Node’s Behavior
---

Each node will have its own configuration (which varies depending on its type) to determine how the node will behave when executed. For instance, a `Show Info Modal` type node will have a `Message` configuration field, which determines what message will be displayed when the node is executed.

To configure the behavior of a node:

1. Click on the node. The node’s configuration form will appear on the right side of the editor. In the image below, we clicked the `show_message_modal` node and its configuration form is displayed on the right panel.

   <img
     style={{ maxHeight: "400px", margin: "auto" }}
     src="/images/img11.png"
   />

2. Fill in the form and click the `Submit` button to edit the node’s configuration.
