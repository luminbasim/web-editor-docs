title: Renaming a Node
---

Every node in a workflow graph has a unique name. You will often want to change the name of a node to make its purpose in the workflow easier to identify.

The usual convention for node names is `{NODE_TYPE}:{CUSTOM_NAME}`. Note that node names should only consist of alphanumeric characters, an underscore, or a colon.

To rename a node:

1. Click on the node.

2. In the node’s configuration form, click on the pencil icon next to the node’s name.

   <img
     style={{ maxHeight: "400px", margin: "auto" }}
     src="/images/img12.png"
   />

3. In the node name input box, type the node’s new name.

   <img
     style={{ maxHeight: "400px", margin: "auto" }}
     src="/images/img13.png"
   />

4. Press the `Enter` key to save the node’s new name (you do not need to click the `Submit` button here).
